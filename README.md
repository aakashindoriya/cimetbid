Hereâ€™s a `README.md` for your bid management system:

# Bid Management System

The **Bid Management System** is a MERN stack-based project that allows administrators to create products (property or vehicles) and manage bidding activities. Users can place bids on products, and the system tracks these bids to determine winners.

## Features

- **User Management**: Register, login.
- **Product Management**: Admins can create and list products (property or vehicle), with photo uploads.
- **Bidding System**: Users can place bids on products, with validation ensuring bids are higher than the starting price.
- **Bid Tracking**: Products are associated with bids through product references, rather than storing bids in the product schema.
- **Web Sockets**: User and admin will receive live notification when a new product is created and when a new bid is placed
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API to manage users, products, and bids.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js ,chakra ui
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Token (JWT)
- **Image Upload**: Multer for handling product image uploads
- **Environment Variables**: Managed by dotenv

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aakashindoriya/cimetbid
   cd cimetbid/server

   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

   ```env
   PORT=8080
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints
